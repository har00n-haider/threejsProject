Just a project to understand and build on three.js with a simple game engine

# game engine 

Super simple game engine that uses three.js. Features:

- Component based game objects based on the three.js basic type
- Ultra simple particle system build with help from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFqENgtqRAY&t=69s&ab_channel=SimonDev) tutorial


Currently just branching from this repo's master for different projects (commiting engine stuff to master)
